 * Custom hook to handle button disabling during the execution of an asynchronous function.

 * This hook disables the button when the asynchronous operation starts, and re-enables it once the operation finishes,
 * regardless of whether it was successful or encountered an error.
 *
 * @param {Function} asyncFunction - The asynchronous function to be executed when the button is clicked.
 * @returns {Array} An array containing:
 *  - {boolean} isDisabled - A boolean indicating whether the button is currently disabled.
 *  - {Function} handleClick - The function to be used as the button's onClick handler, managing the execution of the async function and button disabling.
